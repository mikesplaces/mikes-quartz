My wife told me this morning after she had been out seeing friends, that this person she believed was her friend and that helped us around the house was saying in our old neighborhood that my wife mistreated her. This is kind of the Khmer way but it really bothers me. This person we helped with her son, each month we helped with money and only wanted work done, and then they could play fishing or going wherever. I had written before on [[Satisfying others]] how this all unraveled. 

We are not rich but we are definitely not poor in Cambodian culture. Consider that most people here make a few hundred dollars a month. My son in law  works and makes more but he gets no time off. So the money I make on retirement here is not a fortune but its not a pittance. It gives us a life that others look at and would like to have. My wife has told me many times how she appreciates all she has now.

This so-called "friend" did this same thing before to us and my wife rose above. Took the high road. Wanted the friendship. Money messed up the whole thing and unfortunately the woman and her husband just drink the money away they do get. I've asked her before to please not drink around me. I don't like khmer drinking culture at all.

So the real measure of it all is to see just how unimportant truth is when someone is faced with a decision about another person. This whole thing ended on Taphul Street and not face to face or even on a call. I never want the woman around me again. 

## Sihanoukville ahead

In some days we go to the beach. I really cannot wait but yet I don't think I want to see how the village has changed. We will see Daran there. He is my favorite of Alin's sons. Hard working, always asks about us when he talks to his sister, will send me $10 and tell Alin its for daddy to have coffee.

Behind us will be the detritus of a failed friendship. In the rear view mirror.  I think things in the mirror get distorted or lost as we gain distance but I will never let this time go with Alin's friend. Going to a bungalow for days of really nothing besides beach time is a nice Now thing. 

## always wanting less

I think this is a constant with me. The idea of having more things has never been a desire or need. I have no watches. No fancy doodads. What I have wanted these days is what I already have. 

1. Wife. Number one thing. She just gives me all and I could want no more from her stubborn and acerbic personality. She adds this context and content to life. Humor and sadness. Some family I love and others I don't care for. Just the day to day with her. The step by step. 
2. This mindfulness thing. For years now it has given and I've taken. But it never demands or requires. From walking to yoga to writing and then meditation. All of it really based on nothing. No grand phrases. No counting breaths. Just nothing. 
3. Cambodia. This funny, strange and sometimes weird place. When I compare life in other places only one really haunts me. Vietnam. There's something there too. People. Things. Places. But with my wife and this life Siem Reap becomes home. I can't imagine not having it.  America is like a distant 1000th. I do see Hanoi. The sunsets and the pace. The wonderful little things there. All considered this home just works. And I want nothing more. 

Things I don't need. People that prevaricate to family. Relationships based on someone demeaning my wife. Then there is the excuse I heard. 

> That's just the Khmer way 

No. Lying and insulting because someone cannot understand we are done with them and must poison the well is not some cultural or social way. Truth and telling it is hard. When the benchmark is set to disregard it in favor of telling others how bad we are. My money spent well though. Fuck all that. 

It all blends together on the writing. My this and that. So I send it out. Figure I will let it sit awhile elsewhere. Now I drink my coffee. Watch the clouds do precision marching with a blue sky. Soon will walk. Then it all peels away. I'll write some on [[Mornings and writing]]. 

More and probably less to come.
