I've enjoyed considering how I want to do the writing. When is not so important. I want a thing to write on and it should do these things for me.

- write and publish as I please. Finished or not. Links to other things finished or not. 
- have less friction and steps. I don't particularly like web editors. Ideally I want to copy a markdown file and have it just work. 
- be able to start a thing on the Mac and return to it in a coffee shop. Perhaps when I'm also writing on [[Siem Reap Days]]. 
- feel good about how it all works. Find satisfaction and joy in the act and art of it. Feel like I own the words. 
- sync the things. This works very well. [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) just does the work from phone to laptop. 

Every so often I look to see how close I am. What I'd need yet. These are some things 

- publish anywhere. I'd like to have no blockers or limits. Now with quartz there is. I can write and share and rewrite and find the words again in obsidian on the phone but I cannot say "sorta kinda done". 
- I'd like to not rely on obsidian. It's not my chosen thing. Quartz does not require it to publish but I settled for it because it's probably the best markdown editor on Android. One day I _will_ change. To what who knows. 
- feel the continuum between the first and second things daily. Writing and publishing and just doing. Being able to use my android phone in a coffee shop is ideal. 

When I look at blogging platforms now I can't imagine going there. Each of them has some issue or limit. None let me write how I want. They kind of insist on starts and ends to me. My day to day life in Cambodia does not have that. I feel like life is a continuum of connections. It's up to me to find them. Think on them. Socrates said once,

> The unexamined life is not worth living. 

It's worth the words used to make it up. We are not casual observers. We should examine the life. I believe when we do we find the web of connections. Some are opportunistic and may fade away with but a thought. Others give us a step by step. How should we put these into our lives. Let them touch each other. Find the worth. 

There's no answer for us all. What works for me probably will fail you. Maybe you could not live an ultimately simple life in a developing country. Find a completely different culture and then a woman that loves you in it. 

## so let's write it 

That's what I choose. For me I have no one to easily talk to about the examination and worth so I write it out. Life is a swing. A pull. A motion.  The writing for me means to find the pull. Put words down not for posterity but for now. Dammit! I mean Now. To me journals are delicate fingers of exploration and investigation. This looking for and find the life worth living. Then I can take the things and distill them, find what I really want to say and have a place to put them. A place where nothing is done. Where things are practices [^1]

Then there's the connections. Random and unforseen. Here I see them this morning in Star Coffee. My wife shares a TikTok video. Life wheels. 

And that's where blogging goes. Don't give me some tool that won't let me examine and find my own worth. The current crop of blogging platforms do nothing really to let me find all this. Then share it. They create friction. There's a boundary between your words and you making it available out there. I choose to want less. The less I have found is [Blot](https://blot.im/). One day perhaps I will go back. It needs to be healthy again. Now I fear it. The rest fall away. Tried them. Felt less than impressed. I don't need a thing that goes even less distance than what I have now for free. Why pay for less. 

## finally

It's only me that writes this debitage. My feelings where blogging goes. Where it stops short. I'll go back to my coffee now. 



[^1]: A practice is a doing and being and not achieving or finishing to me. It is the act of doing. There is no goalpost to cross over. This makes life's most wondrous moments practices to me. The things to do not expecting to ever be done or to get some reward or say "done".  I also feel that these things reward me the most by not marching to a goal or milestone. Once they do that, they are not what propels me forward or makes me want more.
