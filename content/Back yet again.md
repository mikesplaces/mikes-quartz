Seems amazing to me I have not found a place to write that compels me or makes me want to write like blot does. I can't go back to blot now. Things just seem so broken there. So I came here yet again. I can't do pika. Don't care for their web editor and lack of markdown support. I want to write how I want. Not bend things yet again. 

So what's the outcome here? Simple. There is none. This is a more flexible and easier way to publish almost out of obsidian.

## what I do know 

Words are important to me. Getting them down is. Finding where all the little things connect is. Some of the things I've journaled about lately are happiness and solitude. Writing those words down let me see I need to find other avenues. More ways to get my thoughts out. 

And here I am.
