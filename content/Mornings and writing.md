I enjoy writing in the morning with a coffee. I seem to have either the same or new thoughts and music filters in and out. Since this site is kinda made for reflections of the ongoing type, I figure a blog post that never ends and could be snippets of a morning could be interesting. I sometimes toot on Mastodon on the today things. Many people do with the hashtag. But mornings here are different. I remember living in Vietnam and things started going early in Hanoi. I could hear the lady that sells chickens down the street. Hear cars and motos. My neighbor was up early for work and she would head to the roof there to cook some stuff. Here, its different. Mornings can be quiet until the magical time of talking.

My morning this morning was only spent as usual. I get the coffee going and have thoughts. Will this morning's walk take me to coffee at x or y. Is my wife happy talking with the neighbors? I think about our upcoming Sihanoukville trip. We are not gonna be in the city proper. Our place is in Otres Village. Its close to one of the more beautiful beaches. Walking its km of shoreline when I was there before was wonderful. Now all things have changed. 

My wife has been out walking this morning. She will offer to make breakfast for me. I usually don't eat a breakfast meal in favor of fresh fruit. This morning it will be dragon fruit. She bought a whole bunch of them so I will partake. I think they are all red ones on the inside.

Writing always seems fresher in the morning. Less complicated with fewer inputs and outputs expected. I consider updating my [[Siem Reap Days]] today. Yesterday on a walk. Maybe today on something else. Right now words working with music seem like the way to go. I also seem to have these rogue ideas in the mornings about things I want to write. Longer and shorter things. Blurbs in the journals. I can hear voices now. Sometimes soft but most of the time here everyone is packed in way too close for my liking so I get to hear the neighbors in Khmer laughing and telling whatever tales they do. Perhaps mornings for them are richer talking too. I don't do much of that any more. I just have not found a gain to it.

Here's the morning. Today writing on things not so pleasant. The journal full of these less than positive things. So I finished a thing and went to coffee. Wrote a bit on [[Truth Telling is hard]].   

I figure this story on writing is like one of the old serials in the movies. Perhaps you remember them. Just when a thing was about to happen you see,

Well, this story goes on tomorrow.
