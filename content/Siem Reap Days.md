This is my day to day life or so in Siem Reap Cambodia. What I'll do here is write about the things I do. Maybe some photos. Definitely visits to coffee shops and restaurants, pubs and side streets. Kind of organized much like this site. Hardly at all.

I went today to [[ur coffee]]. Always nice. Weather is simply beautiful. We are finishing up with rainy season. There's nothing really to do today besides writing and walking. It makes for rather idyllic days. The walking today was excellent. Weather here has been so nice lately. Now I leave about 830 in the morning. This morning I just walked the longer way to coffee. Once there I can sit and watch people coming and going or just read and write.  

Then I walked home. There is a disturbance in the force at home. My wife's friend that helps here daily has not for two days now. This disturbs her more than me I think. I guess I don't care if she shows up or not. She's been off my dance card for awhile. 

Dinner came. I ate. The day slowly revolves to night. I wrote on relationships and people. Wrote a blog post [[Lets talk Mu]].
