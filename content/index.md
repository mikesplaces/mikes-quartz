This is my writing, blogging, whatever site. There's not a lot of organization. Or any really. Everything comes from Obsidian on my iPhone and MacBook. This is a subset of things I want to publish. One page to rule them all is my [[About, Contact, Now, Then]] page. Everything you did not want to know.

## Some things here

- [[Journaling]] - some thoughts I always have on journaling
- [[Siem Reap Days]] - a running commentary on coffee, sometimes beer, a few reviews. Life in the city I love. 
- [[Mornings and writing]] - a never ending blog post. Yeah they are a thing to me. This one will just take the mornings and distill them to no appreciable order but I love writing in the mornings.

All of these probably get updated and links added or changed as I go. 

Part of the nice thing about using this static site generator. If you are looking for a way to publish obsidian, give  [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) a look and see. All of this cruft gets crossposted to Mastodon. Wow! What a deal.
