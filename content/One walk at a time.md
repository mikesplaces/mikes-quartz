One of the things on a day is the walk. I combine it with having [[coffee times]] and also with my [[Siem Reap Days]]. What I want is to show this view of the city and what I see. Perhaps not every day but the fun now is being able to write this way. Create ever changing tapestries of words I can change easily since my website really is nothing more than a static site generator which takes markdown files and sends them off to GitHub Pages. 

There's no real point in planning things or thinking I will do X on Y date. I rebel against it inside. Instead its a take off on what my wife says about things. Her ultimate planning technique is,

> step by step

We get to a place at our pace. Same with the every day. Same with writing. What the F is the point starting and finishing any more when its all steps. A thing I can add a link to whenever I want.  

So over morning coffee music goes and I write. Today I will walk. Find a thing or two to show or think on. I guess the main thing is to never finish. That seems the way of writing and doing now. My Android gizmo does its part. 

## starting later

On my walk. My coffee. Those are the best time I think for me. The house means little to me so I try to minimize it. Siem Reap is one of the cities that is a perfect size for exploration and getting lost in. Its not an adventure like Taiwan or Tokyo or a wanderer's delight like Merida. Instead it has all the pieces one wants but I find it not terribly big or suffocatingly small. 

Life's been good here. I never thought in 2022 I would stay here. Originally it was to get the retirement visa and then leave for some place else. Vietnam is always in mind. Or Malaysia. Instead I guess I took a different set of steps. Found something I thought I would never have again. Relationships are funny things. Especially across these cultures. My wife has this dedication and desire to see me happy in things. I guess I am somewhat broken with that. I just am not a totally happy, or unhappy, person. I am just me. The most I can offer is honest feelings. This has made her mad and sad at times. All of these steps have meant both of us change. What else could happen. 

i've enjoyed these walks. Many of them lined with ideas or thoughts. It used to be I called my blog "Mikes Thoughts". I felt then that most of the things I wrote on were these personal life pieces. I did write on the day in Vietnam for awhile. I enjoyed that a lot. Photos and stories and then going somewhere else to take a walk and tell a story or two. Those blogs and words are long gone.

Now I have another walk to take.
