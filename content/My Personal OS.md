Just like we run some operating system on a piece of hardware or virtual hardware, we as human beings also run an OS I think. One of the things I've thought a bit on since reading [this](https://www.originalmacguy.com/unlock-your-thoughts-how-obsidian-can-help-you-record-and-develop-your-ideas/)
was what the "Mike OS" should be. There's a story under each story to me. For a place I've been, there's a place I left before. One of the things though is the thought along with it. I've tried a variety of [[Journaling]] approaches and the one that's stuck is a daily journal and that's it. I have tried numerous times the theme or topic journals and have had success or failure or both. What I decided in developing my OS is I need only a few things.

- no organization or little. My life is not some model of organization so how I think, write, act, react is not based on some tried and true method of organizing ideas or content. 
- not the idea that "there is an app for that". Really it should be finding the words and if the app comes along, great.
- no limits because who wants to think in limits. Who sets on a walk or writing something to publish and insists on some limit or even some idea? I don't. What's the point of that if there is no organization or an app that neatly fills the bill.
- no time for it. There is no set aside time to delve into the thoughts, feelings, ideas. There is just writing them. I started this idea of [[Mornings and writing]] and [[Siem Reap Days]] as this continuous iteration. I want away from times. 
- The OS should be as malleable and changeable as me. I should be able to decide at a whim to do something with it I want and not feel its constrained.

So the inevitable question is,

> great! you got your own OS. What's gonna be in it?

The answer is I have no real idea. This is not some classic project or timeline or task based nonsense. People do enough of those in a lifetime. What is needed is spontaneous creation and seeing where it goes. My OS thrives on meeting and going beyond my criteria above. if an idea comes to me when I am walking, I should be able to sit down and write it out on the phone. If I am having a beer over at Beatnik Bar and a thing comes to me it should have a path. A way out.

I also need a file system. A thing. I just chose Obsidian to be the file system. It does not insist on some structure. I can use folders or links or tags. Or none at all. There is no minimum. I could use something else. I want to not be limited by what an app thinks I should do or some website. So I use something more open to record and publish [^1]. 

## The final things

What we all need I think is a place. A space for our personal OS. It can be notebooks or mindmaps or drawings or, in my case, markdown files. What I realized is that all the things in my OS link to other things in it but I don't know them (yet). When do we ever reach some point where we can say,

> great! got it all. I'm done with all this exploration. 

I hope never.  In the meanwhile, here is some Vietnam because things are never finished there either.

Vietnam always leaves me wanting more. Some scene I just find makes me remember what was down that street. That Mural Street where I would stop and people watch, have a coffee, and stroll each wonderful piece of work. Never done. When I went back in 2023, they had changed it all again. 


[^1]: some of this came to me out walking and a lot came from just cruising the web on a singular search about writing my thoughts in obsidian. What I came away with is there is no way. There's no method to create so the best way doing it is just do it. No rules. Little organization. No requirements. Just do it. Lets see where all this takes me.
