Lately my wife has been upset with a friend of hers. She wants to help her friend but won't just give money. She feels working to earn the money is the right thing. I have to admit I gave up on the person weeks ago. We had gone away for a few days and arguments and rhetoric persisted on the phone. About money and working. I leave the money stuff up to my wife. She takes care of us and ensures we have food, money to get away, water to drink. Well all the stuff. I could do it here but it's far easier to just do what I want. That's not much by the way. I guess what I want is a simple life here. I want to only do the things I wish to do. My wife does the same mostly but she also happily cooks for me, buys shoes and clothes for me when she feels I need them, and takes care of the house stuff. 

It seems other people though can never be satisfied with what they get. We pay her friend monthly to help in the house. This started well but I think it changed character. It became paying someone to be a friend. This simply does not work. I told my wife before,

> If you want to fuck up a friendship just have money involved 

She got it. But not. She will always try again. The thing always is people begin to expect a thing. Her friend has not worked for us and then called drunk demanding money. Threatened to come over and take it. For me that was enough. But things change and morph into other things. Soon things were different. Yet the same. And we went to Battambang a month ago. The acrimony then started again because my wife caught her friend lying. Lying about being at the house and about doing some things she asked while we were gone. Soon it all degenerated to yelling and anger. So the breadcrumb trail here is...

- friendship ➡️ money ➡️ acrimony and hatred

Truth is it's all the fault of money and the mistaken belief it's okay to pay someone to he a friend. Something will break there. And it did. 

## so what's the rule

There is none. I told my wife if she wanted the person as a friend to move beyond money. But it's too fucking late. Once done and the desire for satisfaction sets in there is no undoing. 

The expectation is set. The deal is dialed. Friendships don't survive money. So I left on my [[Siem Reap Days]] thing. Walking and coffee. Setting no expectations on the person. It's more peaceful now. The house is quieter. I don't feel being taken advantage of so often. I love my wife dearly.

Love all the parts of her. I don't much like when we try to satisfy others and it's met with anger or issues. So I just stopped before. Didn't give a F if the person was there or not. 

## and now?

Now I drink my coffee out. Find my own measure of only wanting to make my wife happy and mom. My daughter in law tells me it's plenty. She's wise and counsels well. And I love her. 

We will go on. Do what we do. Love our little lives together. Hopefully not try to satisfy people like her friend that refuse. I'm glad I don't really have friends here. I'm not good friend material. 

Khmer culture so different. But human nature seems bound by the same immutable laws. One of them is money is just no good when it involves friendship. 

Satisfying another person also hard when the goal posts forever move. When the other person drinks and sets the blame scale. Then I'm done.
