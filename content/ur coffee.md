Today is Ur coffee. One of my favorite places. Walking here is often through the local market. Like to look at the food and stuff. I come out of the market and still have a nice walk here.

This place is peaceful and quiet. Mostly Khmer people here but everyone welcome. It's a shady and quiet place. Interesting I don't use their wifi. Never have. I use my cell service here. Like most places I go. Just seems easier. 

I can sit here an hour. No one comes along to tell me times up.  Coffee shops here are meant to be relaxing and social places. I don't do the social part but if they have nice chairs and people are not jammed in I'm good. 

The part of town we live in I've managed to find a number of regular places to meet my need and desire. Today was delightful at Ur. The baristas and waitresses serve with a smile and then just as quickly leave each customer to their times. Ur is one of the wonderful Khmer coffee houses I really enjoy.
