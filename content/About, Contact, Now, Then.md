Sorry. I don't do those things separately. Some I don't do at all.

## About

The site is really about nothing at all. It has no goals. Nothing it wants to be when it grows up. It really is just a dumping ground for words. Arranged in no particular order or reason. I grow this site by writing. Then publishing when I want. I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) on this site and then GitHub Pages.  I don't do challenges, weekly reports or any of that crap. I figure people do those things when they have nothing else to write about. I don't suffer that problem. Same with crufty pages about other stuff. I don't do multiple blogs. What's the point? If you cannot tell your story on one blog, what the F is the point in multiples. 

Now I live in Siem Reap Cambodia with my wife Alin. Its a nice life. I spent some years wandering around Asia. Lived in Mexico awhile. Came back in 2022. Then I met my wife. Now we live here. Often we travel around Cambodia and sometimes outside. Alin is from Siem Reap but her family lives in Preah Vihear province. That's about 3 hours away from here. I consider Cambodia my home now. Can't imagine ever living in America again. Alin spoils me with a wonderful life. I do my job. That would be according to my wife,

Been doing this blogging thing for some years. I think since about 1998. There was this site then we would write on called Advogato. I worked for a spell at Technorati when it was a blogging resource. Then I just spilled words all around different places. I also worked at a few .com startups back in the day. Around Linux mostly. Maybe you don't remember Linuxcare. Don't blame you. That was ages ago.
