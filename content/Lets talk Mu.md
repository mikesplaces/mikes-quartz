Do you know Mu? I have to admit I did not but I found the thing rather amazing.  Here's a definition.

> Mu means "no thing." Like "quality" it points outside the process of dualistic discrimination. Mu simply says, "no class: not one, not zero, not yes, not no." It states that the context of the question is such that a yes and a no answer is in error and should not be given. "Unask the question" is what it says.

There is this space. Between yes and no. Right and wrong. Talking and silence. I was watching this youtube video [The History of Japanese Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Fp0MCgYQY).  The narrator tells the story about pausing between words in a sentence. We may find the pause disconcerting or uncomfortable. Japanese people may find it as necessary as the words that surround it.

I guess the thing which I love to think on is that life is not about process and absolutes. It is this pause between things. How we can find a lifetime or a meaning between yes and no, Up and down. Right and wrong. Even Love and hate. I think we western people love the absolutes. The yes and no things. The idea that there is a world between and that world is populated by strange and wonderful ideas or non ideas could be frustrating. Or enlightening. Or neither according to Mu. 

Perhaps the times spent doing things for outcomes and results lets us not find the delicate condition between. We are used to competition and winning. Losing. Tasks with completion ticks. I don't think writing has to be that way.  Once we stop with the gain and loss. We find the no class. The not one or zero. There's this place between I see in some writing before. The activity itself without being concerned with an outcome.

Perhaps that is also how writing like this gives more. We want Mu. Because its different and lets us find the space and place between our words. Just as comforting as the words is the meaning between.

So how do we embrace it?  This classless and not yes or no. We have to become between. Find the embrace of the words between the other words. Perhaps invisible or never said or just felt. To me, when we write we often can find this thing Mu. It exists when we don't want to finish but our tools and brains and senses say "done". Instead we should find the connections between. Our worlds are not a vacuum. Each thing I believe is connected by this web. When we stop at yes or no, we stop. 

Perhaps this writing and world building is more difficult and perplexing for how blogging and journaling works. We want the things to have dates and the stories to start and end. How else to fit it all together. To make it make sense. I have an answer, of course.

it does not have to make sense. It is this distance between sense and nonsense.  Perhaps there are whole worlds that live there in Mu. Some think so.
