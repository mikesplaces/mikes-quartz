I've given a lot of thought to how I journal and why. Years ago I was a dedicated Day One user. I had about three years invested in the app on iPhone and Mac. Something came apart for me though a few years ago and I stopped. I wanted something different. Something that was kinda future proof. One of the sites I read about journaling was [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/dj). Another was a followup discussion to topic journaling and how for [one person](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/how-i-write-daily-notes-differently/) it became the default type of journal to write. There's two different and distinct concepts to me.

1. Daily Journaling. This has seemed always like a top-down approach to writing a journal. I can start a daily journal with the best of intentions and then link to things i create throughout the day. This leaves a nice representation of a daily journal and links to writing I do. Any kind of writing really. But something has seemed missing in this. It feels like a shotgun approach to writing a journal. 
2. Topic Journaling. I started with this some time ago but stopped and started a few times after. I think sometimes I feel things get very focused on either good or bad outcomes of life and I would like to instead feel like this journaling is a flow of ideas where I can creatively link to other things as I go. Some things I have already done. Others are created. By using a date with a H2 header and a wikilink I get the daily journal note created each day but most often its empty. What happens instead is the bottom-up approach. I write on things in thematic journals which come to me. I create new things which also come or I update existing ones. This works for me much better since I feel I am more involved with the creation and writing of things, linking them when i want, writing more things. 

The second approach I believe leads to more creativity and spontaneity in writing. Instead of starting with a date. I start with words. I just feel this yields more involvement and I find more things which excite, distress, or frustrate me as I go. 

That's what for me I think journaling is really about. I do this because I really have no one to trot out these ideas to. My wife would listen but I can hear her now telling me to

> stop overthinking

Well I am a died in the wool overthinker. I also want to see all the little pinpricks of life and what touches what. How a walk influences a coffee. How a coffee touches a message from my daughter in law asking to go to coffee with me. How an idea becomes something else. Some blog post or thing between.

## and that gets me to writing here

This is a thing between to me. This is not a blog per se. Its not a garden either. I don't proclaim some lofty second brain idea or ideals or wish to zettelkasten my way to complete organization. In fact, its opposite to me. I do not use obsidian to be organized. I use it because it tracks my lack of organization so well. To kind of control the mayhem, I use links a lot and tags not at all. I don't like folders much either but I use a few. Everything kinda lives in one folder and I write these hub notes to connect the dots. To let me find a thing if I'm lazy and don't want to search it out.

So obsidian is not a task manager or second brain or organizational toolkit. I use it because I don't want those things and I can bend it to my will. it is what obsidian was meant for I think. There is no default configuratioin. No ideal state. In my case, my writing is less than that by many degrees. It simply blossoms and grows however it wants. I'm just sometimes an observer creator. I can start observing easily and see where an idea could spread. It could become this thing called "blogpost" although these days I am not sure what that means. Perhaps my journal on my wife finds something in my journal on happiness and says "oh yeah". Who is to say which way is right when there is no right or wrong way.

What I think the idea of Mikes Writing is about is simply to do what Plato asked of us t consider and that is,

> The _unexamined life_ is not worth living

How we account for it, do it, find what to examine is up to us. No one tells us how much to write on a day. What we should say. it truly is our examination. I just found this way to create my own using a tool which hopefully I can forget in favor of finding words to remember.

## how we start is how we finish

There is no start or finishing to journaling. It is just doing. It is a practice. An activity of doing. We should just go with it. Find the thing you want. Don't sweat the words. A paragraph or a page matters not to anyone else. You are doing this for you. Most of all there is no done state. Perhaps that's the thing with classical blogging that gets me down and why both the daily journals and blogging needed a kick in the nether regions. Neither accounts for change too well. With a daily journal we get a day. But that day ends and another starts. On and on. I like to look at the words first each day instead. 

For blogging we get a start and end, date published, and a permalink. Somehow lately that seems limiting to me if we are talking that this writing is an evolving and changing thing. Ready to morph as you are. So instead of counting steps or words or sentences, instead just go. 

See where it takes you. Maybe nowhere. Maybe you find some other things as you go. I've had both happen.
