This regular place I love. Music and vibes and this peace here. Really enjoy just how they do things here.

The morning stops always seem to be a start for me. Coffee out seems like a tradition. Now I have these places. LaLatte seems like a place i cam just stop and enjoy.

I've been coming here since we first moved. Almost a year. It's a nice walk. From here so many places can be reached. I'll write a little on [[Siem Reap Days]] days on Wat Bo. Lovely district to walk in. Would not mind living there either. 

Thanks to LaLatte  coffee. Always giving moments and surroundings I love.
