We're getting close to our beach trip. Getting away this time means a sleeper bus first. Then a bungalow at the nice level. Undoubtedly otres village has changed. When I was there in 2018 it was a slow paced dirt road endeavor. No rush to do anything. 

Change was on the horizon then. Chinese people buying the restaurants. Building a huge apartment building for the workers. I got to watch all this then just starting.  We would walk to the beach in the evenings for sunset and then back to a Khmer restaurant for dinner. There were a few international places too. 

The people staying then were a mix of retirees, tourists, and people I can only call hippies. Yeah. This created this wonderful sense of surrealism in a town with only a dirt road and a bumpy tuktuk ride to get there. I would walk then this way and that. Mostly though by the beach. That long km long beach that took me by private bungalows with people playing beach volleyball enclosed even then by fences, the small groups of Khmer walking along or sipping beer under the trees that lined theh walk, and every so often a fellow walker. It was an idyllic existence where the power went off every so often and I would sit out front and share beers with my Cambodian next door neighbor. 

We had no AC then in the bungalows. It was warm. Warmer inside it seemed with no fan to drive around the air. It was an easy walk to one of the restaurants or first to the beach to watch the show in the evenings. It happened my favorite place to eat was this BBQ place with some of the best Khmer cooking. Cold beers, steak, veggies. A stream of conversation from other tables. The waitress kept an eye on the beer in our glasses.

Then the show would start.

And I would stop. 

I have other memories of being there a month. My one ride into downtown Sihanoukville. Seeing casinos and nice pubs and restaurants. Impatient to get back to the dirt road of the village. Something even then seemed askew in the city. Like I had gone too far in too many directions and I was all warped around.

## now back again

So with all these little things bouncing around, it seems I should remember and then look forward to a new Otres Village. Before was then. Now I go with my wife. Time away. A beach that probably looks the same. Changes though. Things change. We will go spend 3 days along the beach. Ignore the city this time. 

The blog will take a little hiatus since I won't be taking the laptop. But the fediverse will get some goodies.
